# VisageUX — Consent

By enabling the extension, you agree to the collection of interaction events (clicks, scrolls, keystroke types—not content), viewport info, and optional aggregated affect **labels** if you opt in to the camera. **No images or video frames are stored.** Data is pseudonymous via hashed session IDs. You can revoke consent anytime from the extension’s options page.
