# VisageUX â€” Privacy

- Session IDs are hashed; no raw PII collected.
- Optional camera-based affect runs on-device; only label ticks (e.g., neutral/confused) may be sent if you opt in.
- Aggregates may include differential-privacy noise in dashboards.
- You may request deletion of your pseudonymous session data at any time.
